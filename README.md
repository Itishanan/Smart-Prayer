# Smart Prayer App

## Overview

**Smart Prayer App** is an innovative mobile application designed to enhance the practice of Namaz (Islamic prayer) by integrating modern technology with traditional religious practices. This app leverages machine learning, specifically TensorFlow, to provide users with an interactive and personalized experience, ensuring that their prayer practices are accurate and fulfilling.

## Features

- **Prayer Time Notifications:** Receive timely reminders for each prayer based on your location.
- **Prayer Guidance:** Step-by-step guidance on how to perform each prayer correctly.
- **Posture Recognition:** Uses TensorFlow to analyze and provide feedback on your prayer postures.
- **Qibla Direction:** Compass feature to help you find the correct direction for prayer (towards Mecca).
- **Customizable Alerts:** Set custom alerts for prayers, Quran reading, and other religious practices.
- **Progress Tracking:** Track your prayer habits and receive insights on areas for improvement.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For building the cross-platform mobile application.
- **TensorFlow**: For implementing machine learning algorithms to recognize and correct prayer postures.
- **Firebase**: For user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates.
- **Dart**: The programming language used within the Flutter framework.
